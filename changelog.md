and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- closure / object callbacks uses local method invocation (instead of Web Socket) when both the client in same JVM (i.e. ClientAndServer, JUnit Rule, etc)

### Changed
- improved X509 certificates by adding Subject Key Identifier and Authority Key Identifier
- stopped delay being applied twice on response actions (#721)
- improve support for clients making initial SOCKS or HTTP CONNECT requests over TLS

### Fixed
- fixed null point for expectation initialiser with file watcher in working directory specified with relative path

## [5.9.0] - 2020-02-01

### Added
- added stopAsync method to ClientAndServer to allow stop without waiting
- log events for UPDATED_EXPECTATION and REMOVED_EXPECTATION
- ability to update existing expectation by id
- hot re-loading of expectation initialiser file
- addition configuration for web socket client event loop size
- addition configuration for action handler thread pool size
- exposed request raw bytes to object callbacks (allows forwarded requests body parsing that is inconsistent with Content-Type header)
- added support to delay socket closure using connection options
- added support to control trusted certificate authorities (trust store) for proxied & forwarded requests
- added support for two-way TLS (mTLS), also called client authentication
- now sends TLS X509 certificate from proxy (i.e. support forward client authentication / mTLS)
- added ability to dynamically create local unique Certificate Authority (CA) X.509 and Private Key to improve securiy of clients trusting the CA

### Changed
- performance improvements for header and cookie handling
- improved JSON validation errors by adding link to OpenAPI Specification
- removed duplicate packages between modules to prepare for java modules
- caught Jackson configuration exception to improve resilience with other Jackson versions in classpath
- moved Junit4 to separate module to reduce size of jar-with-dependencies, simplify code and increase build speed
- enabled case insensitive matching for regex matches
- improved documentation (i.e. on website)
- switched from Bouncy Castle to JDK for certificate and private key generation

### Fixed
- fixed error where ClientAndServer does fully wait for client to stop
- fixed ability to specific a log level of OFF
- fixed bug with keystore type configuration not being used in all places
- added file locking and jvm locking for expectation persistence file to avoid file corruption
- fixed verification incorrectly matching verifier non-empty bodies against empty request bodies
- stopped response callbacks for proxied requests blocking threads
- fixed bug that caused JSON bodies in specified expectations as raw JSON to ignore empty arrays and empty strings

### Security
- updated tomcat (used in integration tests) to version without vulnerabilities

## [5.8.1] - 2019-12-23

### Added
- changelog
- added configuration for all CORS headers
- added support for forward proxy authentication (via configuration)
- added support for overriding forward responses by class or closure
- requests sent to MockServerClient can be updated / enhanced i.e. to support proxies
- dynamic creation of a unique (i.e. local) Certificate Authority X509 Certificate and Private Key instead of using the fixed Certificate Authority X509 Certificate and Private Key in the git repo.
- configuration to require mTLS (also called client authentication or two-way TLS) for all TLS connections / HTTPS requests to MockServer
- configuration of trust store and client X.509 used during forwarded and proxied requests to endpoints requiring mTLS
- extended TLS documentation significantly

### Changed
- reduced default number of fail handles used by nio event loop
- improved performance and scalability of logging ring buffer
- improved performance of json serialisation
- deprecated isRunning and replaced with hasStopped and hasStarted to make behaviour more explicit and faster
- improved, simplified and unified handling of Content-Type for bodies
- remove closure callback clients and connections for expectation that no longer exist
- ensure WebSockets for closure callback auto re-connect for unreliable networks
- simplified XML and JSON of bodies in the log and UI
- improved logging for CORS
- added support for TLS with closure / WebSocket callbacks
- simplified handling of TLS and HTTP CONNECT (which is always TLS)
- improved JSON format for expectation to support objects instead of escaped strings

### Fixed
- fixed reading logLevel from system property or environment variable
- ensure all errors are printed to console
- removed TLSv1.3 to avoid any issues with JVM version that do not support TLSv1.3
- handle proxying requests without Content-Length header
- added support for JSON array for raw JSON in requests or responses body

### Security
- updated jetty (used in code examples) to version without vulnerabilities

## [5.8.0] - 2019-12-01

### Added
- added support for configuration via environment variables
- added support for overriding responses which an forward overridden request
- added persistence of expectations to file (as json)

### Changed
- ensured all Netty threads are marked as daemon to ensure MockServer does not prevent / delay JVM shutdown
- improved docker-compose example
- improved helm document & example to show how to provide configuration file or expectation initialiser
- improved performance and throttled load for UI

### Fixed
- WARN and ERROR is logged even if logLevel not yet initialised
- ensured exceptions thrown in Main method are always logged
- separated control plane and data plane matching to avoid reverse regex matches and other similar strange behaviour
- fixed handling of multiple parameters in Content-Type header
- autodetect WS or WSS for UI update WebSocket depending on HTTP or HTTPS
- stopped usage being printed multiple time under certain error scenarios

### Removed
- removed re-entrant WebSocket prevention by creating WebSocket client per expectation to improve resilience

## [5.7.2] - 2019-11-16

### Added
- added setting to control maximum size of event log

### Changed
- performance enhancements
- improved matcher failure log messages to output detail at DEBUG level
- made log level configuration more resilient
- allowed exceptions to be thrown from all types of callback methods

### Fixed
- fixed duplicate logging or request when optimistic proxying
- added missing exception on bind error
- ensured client event bus is not static so it not shared across multiple client instances except were server port is identical

## [5.7.1] - 2019-11-09

### Added
- added disruptor ring buffer in front of log to improve performance
- added configuration to ensure MockServer certificate is not updated once created

### Changed
- improved performance with request matcher fast failure
- refactored CPU or memory hot spots
- switched logging to simpler more resilient approach without external dependencies

### Fixed
- fixed log levels to support disabling the log completely without impacting verifications
- ensured clear, reset and verify guarantee all pending log events are completed
- ensured all thread pools (i.e. added disruptor, etc) are stopped with stopping MockServer or Servlets
- respond with not found response (instead of hanging) when failure during template rendering

## [5.7.0] - 2019-11-01

### Added

- improved resilience of request and response parsing, such as when Content-Type is blank string
- improved proxy loop prevention to only break loops within a single instance of MockServer
- increased length of TLS keys to RSA 2048
